Several sites link to Renato Canova's 2017 talk in Valencia. The [video is still on YouTube](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8646226552989795436/1557066183513453329#), but the [original link](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8646226552989795436/1557066183513453329#) to the slides is broken.  
  
I contacted the [Serrano athletics club on Facebook](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/8646226552989795436/1557066183513453329#), which happily procured the file within a day. Thanks, guys!
