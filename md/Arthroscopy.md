### Arthroscopy

2021-01-31

I had arthroscopic repair on my torn labrum on January 18. I have been told I can return to running in four months. In the meantime, I am doing PT and have switched from [Knoxville Endurance](http://www.knoxvilleendurance.com/) to [LBEndurance](http://lbendurance.com/) to do more swimming and cycling when my body is ready.
