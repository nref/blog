always in search of good metaphors for software design. Good or not, here's one:\n\nA Design is a Mold for Code\n\nIn manufacturing, a mold is a hollow shape that fills with fluid material which expands into the space and sets to form a casting. \n\n  \n  Image: A useful mold. Generated by Dall-E\n\nLike in manufacturing, code fills the negative space of a software design. Over time, code sets and becomes harder to change.\nImagine two engineering teams who independently \"fill\" (implement) a design, and the design is the set of standards for a web browser. The two implementations are Chrome and Firefox. The two browsers have independent codebases[1] which take vastly different shapes, but as far as web standards are concerned, the two are equal. You could switch from Chrome to Firefox (which I recommend) and still browse compliant web pages with no discernible change. \nProgrammers who also like math sometimes call two pieces of code which can be swapped isomorphic with respect to the spec.\nIt's important not to reverse the causality: a design causes the work product, not the converse. A mold causes a casting, and a software design causes code. Nevertheless, to some extent, one can go in reverse, i.e. reconstruct a mold from a casting or infer a design from code. \nThe reconstructed mold might lose some fidelity, like sharp edges or precise dimensions, but it's far worse for code. Looking at code without supplemental information, a new dev can only infer a dim, vague notion of its design. She might even sense the mind(s) behind the design. However, it would be costly if even possible to losslessly reconstruct the design, i.e. to such a fidelity that it could be the basis for an isomorphic implementation.\nIn pseudocode:\n[Test]\nfn Reverse_ProducesIsomorphicDesign()\n    let design1 : ...\n    let code1 = implement(design1)\n    let design2 = reverse(code1)\n    let code2 = implement(design2)\n    assert(isomorphic(code1, code2)) // Fails\n\nAbove: The roundtrip from a design to code back to design is lossy.\nThere are a few reasons for this:\n\nA codebase maybe too large to fit into a dev's head. The codebases for Chrome and Firefox are huge. Like the limited context window of ChatGPT, a human has limited working memory and forgets. Though with time and repetition, knowledge transitions to long-term memory.\nIt's hard to infer high-level concepts from low-level details. For example, decompiling assembly back to C.\nDesign and code have a many-to-many relationship.\n\nThere can be many implementations that satisfy a design.\nThere can be many designs that result in the same code.\n\n\n\nThis is a problem for software that outlives its creator(s). The software will languish unless knowledge is retained and replicated.\nThere are some things developers can do to keep their software alive:\n\nWrite down the design. Use natural language\nMake the design apparent in the code\nUse precise abstractions\nUse effective metaphors\nMake the code fit in your head\n\n\nNotes\n\nFirefox and Chrome are not truly independent by this definition. Plenty of people who have worked on one browser have also worked on the other. Moreover, as open source projects, both teams can see the other's code.

A joint trajectory is the time function interpolating these positions.\nThis post examines generating joint trajectories with cubic splines.\nSay we have a robotic arm with one revolute joint, and we want to rotate its joint position \\(Q\\) from \\(0\\) to \\(90\\) degrees.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ_{init} &amp;= 0 \\newline\nQ_{final} &amp;= \\pi/2 \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFigure: The joint start and goal\nWe don't care how long it takes, but the joint must start from rest and and end at rest.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{init} &amp;= 0 \\newline\nV_{final} &amp;= 0 \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nInitial Solution\nWe can satisfy these constraints by interpolating the joint position, velocity, and acceleration with a  cubic spline,\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ(t) &amp;= At^3 + Bt^2 + Ct + D &amp;&amp;\\text{// Position} \\newline\nV(t) &amp;= 3At^2 + 2Bt + C &amp;&amp;\\text{// Velocity} \\newline\nA(t) &amp;= 6At + 2B &amp;&amp;\\text{// Acceleration} \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhere \\(t\\) is the time since the movement started.\nWe start by finding the coefficients \\(A\\), \\(B\\), \\(C\\), and \\(D\\).\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nDuration &amp;=  \\textit{(To be Determined)} \\newline\nDisplacement &amp;= Q_{final} - Q_{init} \\newline\nA &amp;= \\frac{(2  \\cdot  -Displacement / Duration + V_{init} + V_{final})}{Duration^2} \\newline\nB &amp;= \\frac{(3  \\cdot  Displacement / Duration - 2  \\cdot  V_{init} - V_{final})}{Duration} \\newline\nC &amp;= V_{init} \\newline\nD &amp;= Q_{init} \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nSince we don't care how long the movement takes, let's choose arbitrarily that the movement should last \\(1\\) second:\n$$\nDuration = 1\n$$\nthen we have the coefficients\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA &amp;= (2 \\cdot -(\\pi/2)/1 + 0 + 0)/1^2 = -\\pi \\newline\nB &amp;= (3 \\cdot (\\pi/2)/1 - 2 \\cdot 0 -0)/1  = 3\\pi/2 \\newline\nC &amp;= 0 \\newline\nD &amp;= 0 \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nPlugging these values back into the cubic equations, we can see in the figure that the joint at \\(t = 1s\\) has position \\(Q = \\pi/2&gt;rad\\) and velocity \\(v = 0&gt;rad/s\\).\n\n\n\nFigure: Joint Position, Velocity, and Acceleration over Time\n\nJoint Constraints\nIn reality, a joint may not physically be able to move in 1 second, so let's consider some realistic constraints.\nSay the joint has a maximum angular velocity of  \\(6°/s\\)  and a maximum angular acceleration of \\(3°/s^2\\). Assume this holds true regardless of its payload or position, i.e. ignore dynamics.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{limit} &amp;= 0.104719755 &gt; rad/s \\newline\nA_{limit} &amp;= 0.0523599 &gt; rad/s^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nClearly the solution plotted above exceeds these limits:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{max} &amp;=  3\\pi/4, t = 0.5s \\newline\nA_{max} &amp;=  3\\pi, t = 0s \\newline\n&amp;= -3\\pi, t = 1s \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nWe can reduce the velocity and acceleration by scaling the duration, i.e. making the movement take longer. The time-optimal solution is found analytically according to Melchiorri [1]:\ndouble get_scale()  \n{\n  double v_scale = abs(Vmax) / Vlimit\n  double a_scale = sqrt(abs(Amax) / Alimit)\n  return max(v_scale, a_scale)\n}\n\nIf  a_scale is larger than  v_scale, then the acceleration limit is constraining the duration. If  v_scale is larger than  a_scale, then the velocity limit is constraining the duration.\nv_scale = abs(3π/4) / 0.104719755  = 22.5\na_scale = sqrt(abs(3π)/0.0523599)  = 13.417\n\nIn this case, the velocity limit is the dominating constraint.  The time-optimal duration is 22.5 seconds.\nWe can verify by recalculating the polynomial coefficients with the new duration.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nA &amp;= (2 \\cdot -(\\pi/2)/22.5)/22.5^2 = -0.00027580511 \\newline\nB &amp;= (3 \\cdot (\\pi/2)/22.5)/22.5  = 0.00930842267 \\newline\nC &amp;= 0 \\newline\nD &amp;= 0 \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n\n\nFigure: Scaled Joint Position, Velocity, and Acceleration over Time\nWe can see that the joint at  \\(t = 22.5s\\) has position \\(Q = \\pi/2 &gt;rad\\) and velocity \\(v = 0 &gt;rad/s\\). The maximum velocity is at \\(t = 11.25s\\) with \\(v = 0.104719755 &gt;rad/s\\). The maximum acceleration is at \\(t = 0\\) and \\(t = 22.5s\\) with \\(a = 0.0186 &gt;rad/s^2\\) and \\(a = -0.0186 &gt;rad/s^2\\), respectively. The joint velocity and acceleration constraints are satisfied. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nTask Space Constraints\nLet's add another constraint. Let's say the frame attached to the tip of the joint has maximum translational speed and angular velocity components.\n\nFigure: Diagram of a frame at the joint tip. The frame is right-handed, i.e. Z points out of the page.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\dot{X}_{max} &amp;= 100mm/s \\newline\n\\dot{Y}_{max} &amp;= 100mm/s \\newline\n\\dot{Z}_{max} &amp;= 100mm/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_x}_{max} &amp;= 9°/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_y}_{max} &amp;= 9°/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_z}_{max} &amp;= 9°/s \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nAside: I say components because e.g. a velocity vector moving with \\(\\dot{X} = \\dot{Y} = \\dot{Z} = 100mm/s\\) would actually be moving at \\(\\sqrt{(100²+100²+100²)} ~= 173mm/s\\). One could certainly solve for a velocity vector constraint, too.\nSimilar to joint space constraints, we can meet task space constraints by scaling the duration of the trajectory, but we need to know the relation from joint space to task space.\nThe relation from joint space to task space is known as  forward kinematics. Conversion from joint position to task space position is  forward position, and conversion from joint velocity to task space velocity is  forward velocity. This topic is widely covered elsewhere.\nLet's say our robot joint has position \\(Q\\), angular velocity \\(\\dot{Q}\\) (also known as \\(V(t)\\)), and radius \\(r\\) from its center of rotation to the tip frame. Then the following relations apply:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX &amp;= r \\cdot cos(Q) \\newline\nY &amp;= r \\cdot sin(Q) \\newline\nZ &amp;= 0 \\newline\nR_x &amp;= 0 \\newline\nR_y &amp;= 0 \\newline\nR_z &amp;= Q \\newline\n\\newline\n\\dot{X} &amp;= -\\dot{Q} \\cdot r \\cdot sin(Q) \\newline\n\\dot{Y} &amp;= \\dot{Q} \\cdot r \\cdot cos(Q) \\newline\n\\dot{Z} &amp;= 0 \\newline\n\\dot{Rx} &amp;= 0 \\newline\n\\dot{Ry} &amp;= 0 \\newline\n\\dot{Rz} &amp;= \\dot{Q} \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nFor example, if \\(r = 1 &gt;meter\\),  \\(Q = 0 &gt;rad\\), and \\(Qdot = \\pi &gt; rad/s\\), then\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX &amp;= 1m \\newline\nY &amp;= 0m \\newline\nR_z &amp;= 0m \\newline\n\\dot{X} &amp;= 0 &gt;m/s \\newline\n\\dot{Y} &amp;= 1 &gt;m/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_z} &amp;= \\pi &gt; rad/s \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nFor another example, if \\(r = 1 &gt;meter\\),  \\(Q = \\pi/2 &gt;rad\\), and \\(Qdot = \\pi &gt; rad/s\\), then\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX &amp;= 0m \\newline\nY &amp;= 1m \\newline\nR_z &amp;= 0m \\newline\n\\dot{X} &amp;= -1 &gt;m/s \\newline\n\\dot{Y} &amp;= 0 &gt;m/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_z} &amp;= \\pi &gt; rad/s \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nFor details, see this video lecture.\nGoing back to our 1-second trajectory, since the joint velocity is a parabola, which is symmetric, the maximum occurs at any of \\(t = 0\\), \\(t = 0.5\\), or \\(t = 1\\). Since \\(V_{init} = V_{final} = 0\\), the maximum occurs at \\(t = 0.5\\). This results in the following task space velocities:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ(0.5) &amp;= -\\pi t³ + \\frac{3\\pi}{2}t² = \\pi/4 &gt;rad \\newline\nV(0.5) &amp;= -3\\pi(1/2)² +3\\pi/2  = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} rad/s \\newline\n\\dot{X}_{max} &amp;= \\frac{3\\pi}{4} rad/s \\cdot 1m \\cdot cos(\\pi/4) = 1.67m/s  = 1670 &gt;mm/s \\newline\n\\dot{Y}_{max} &amp;=  \\frac{3\\pi}{4} rad/s \\cdot 1m \\cdot sin(\\pi/4) = 1.67m/s  = 1670 &gt;mm/s \\newline\n\\dot{Z}_{max} &amp;= 0 &gt;mm/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_x} &amp;= 0 &gt;rad/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_y} &amp;= 0 &gt;rad/s \\newline\n\\dot{R_z}  &amp;= \\frac{3\\pi}{4} &gt;rad/s \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nDividing by the given task space constraints yields the following ratios:\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nX_{ratio} &amp;= 1670/100  = 16.7 \\newline\nY_{ratio} &amp;= 1670/100  = 16.7 \\newline\nZ_{ratio} &amp;= 0 \\newline\nR_{x_{ratio}} &amp;= 0 \\newline\nR_{y_{ratio}} &amp;= 0 \\newline\nR_{z_{ratio}} &amp;= \\frac{\\frac{3\\pi}{4} &gt;rad/s}{9°/s} = 15 \\newline\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nThe maximum task space ratio is \\(16.7\\), which is less than the previous value of \\(v_{scale} = 22.5\\).  The previous scaled trajectory duration of 22.5s also satisfies the given task space constraints. \\(\\blacksquare\\)\n\nMultiple Joints\nThe same approach applies to robots with more than one joint. \nIn this case, if we have \\(m\\) joints, then we will have \\(m\\) cubic splines, and \\(a_{scale}\\) and \\(v_{scale}\\) must be calculated for each joint. \nThe scale resulting from dividing the forward velocity by the task space limit is also calculated. The maximum of the joint space ratios and the task space ratio yields the optimal trajectory duration.\nExample\nConsider adding a second joint to the previous example to create a two-joint manipulator. This joint has the same velocity and acceleration limits.\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nV_{limit} &amp;= 0.104719755 &gt; rad/s \\newline\nA_{limit} &amp;= 0.0523599 &gt; rad/s^2\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nFigure: A robot with two joints.\nSimulate this robot on Desmos.

The maximum ratio \\(r_{max}\\) is selected. Then all \\(m\\) splines at segment \\(i\\) are scaled by \\(r_{max}\\).\nPseudocode:\n// Scale the given spline\nvoid scale(segment, ratio): \n\n  segment.duration *= ratio // Update duration\n\n  // Update velocity\n  if (segment.is_first()) spline.Vinit /= ratio\n  if (segment.is_last()) spline.Vfinal /= ratio\n  if (segment.is_intermediate()) spline.Vintermediate /= ratio\n   \n  forward_propagate(segment.next);\n  segment.compute_velocities() // e.g. find new Vintermediate\n  segment.compute_coefficients() // e.g. get A B C D\n\n// Update segment start and finish times\nvoid forward_propagate(segment):\n\n  while (next_segment != null):\n    next_segment.forward_propagate() // e.g. Tinit = Tinit_prev + Duration\n    next_segment= segment.next\n    \n\nAbove: When a segment is scaled, the following changes occur \n\nthe segment duration \nthe segment initial or final velocity (or both)\n\nForward propagation: All segments after the scaled segment are affected: the start time of each spline becomes the finishing time of the previous. These values propagate to the last spline.\nFinally, the resulting intermediate velocities and polynomial coefficients must be recomputed. \n\nReferences\n[1] Biagiotti, L., &amp; Melchiorri, C.

For example, subitizing  is an innate ability. A developmentally normal child can instantly know how many objects are presented, for values up to about 5.\n\n  \n  Image: A die with 5 dots\n\nFrom there, you can teach a 5-year-old arithemetic, for example to add, by having them subitize groups of objects alongside numerals and the math symbol +. This connects their innate notion of quantity to the abstract notion of numbers.\nSICP, a masterpiece in teaching programming, falls heavily on the FP side, though they didn't have that vocabulary at the time. Watch Sussman absolutely rip apart side effects in lecture 5A. But not everybody \"gets\" this approach easily. Even Hal acknowledges in this Corecursive interview that the FP approach didn't work for everyone: \n\nIn the very beginning days, we would teach a sort of short courses for MIT faculty and some of the electrical engineers would just get stuck. \"You haven’t showed us how the transistors work\". ...People think different ways. Some people have to be grounded on where they’re comfortable and for some people, well, it really is transistors. \n\nContrast that to somebody who knows what a function is, in the math sense. The machinery of a transistor , of gates, sources, drains, and TTL will be an irritating detail, like multiplying matrices by hand.\nSo in the dichotomy between introducing FP and IP first, the answer might depend on where the learning is coming from. I personally learned IP and OOP first, because that's what teaching resources were available to me. I was first exposed to FP in college in the form of Scheme. It was disorienting. I couldn't count all the parentheses, let alone grok tail recursion. I wish it could have been presented to me grounded in terms of what I was already comfortable with, for example high school algebra.\nI say, introduce multiple programming paradigms early on, and ground it in what the learner knows. A fundamental programming skill is to think at multiple levels of abstraction. The Haskell programmer needs to be aware that even monads at some point are just bits in a memory hierarchy, just as it's important for an assembly programmer to know that while register allocation is critical to performance, registers are not really what the program is about.\nTo close, let's ground this discussion in something we all know. To design a cathedral, the architect needs to know what bricks will be used. To build a cathedral, the bricklayer needs to envision the noble end to which each brick is set down.\n","id":"https://www.slater.dev/grounded-programming-pedagogy/","title":"Grounded Programming Pedagogy"},"https://www.slater.dev/links/":{"body":"Here are some thinkers and writers I recommend.\nCode\n\nMark Seeman\nJimmy Koppel\nPaul Graham\nEric Lippert\nErik Meijer (no blog; search the web)\nAnders Hejlsberg (no blog; search the web)\nPeter Norvig\nJoel Spolsky\n\nTheology\n\nDerek Griz\n\n","id":"https://www.slater.dev/links/","title":"Links"},"https://www.slater.dev/matrices-are-neural-networks/":{"body":"Chances are you've seen a neural network diagram like this one with circles and arrows:\n\nFigure: A neural network.

I composed training plan with information from both primary and secondary sources, including others' Canova-style training plans, descriptions of his method, video interviews, his own training plans for his athletes, and one very useful talk in Valencia.\nMy self-composed plan called for two quality runs a week: one of longer duration and one of shorter duration but more intensity. The remaining runs were easy miles ending with striders. I did not have time to do a Canova-style base phase, which is arguably the most important part, but I nailed the taper, executing some very aggressive speedwork as late as the week before the race.\nThe cycle produced the following results:\n\nNo injury\nA 54-second PR (2:59:26 → 2:58:30)\nA moderate and early wall starting at mile 19\n\nWas it hard work? Yes. It was a lot of training time and fairly monotonous.\nWould I do it again? I would like to try other methods first, particularly ones with greater variety.\nIs Canova better than method X? Based on what metrics? A sample size of one athlete-cycle does not provide much information. For a metric like Injury Rate, can say that I have completed several Lydiard-style cycles, during all of which I accrued at least one injury. I did not get injured this cycle, but in January 2020 I began another Canova-style cycle, and I strained my calf in February on an easy run the day after a quality workout.\nIs it the best method? In what context? For amateur athletes, I would say \"no\". Canova himself stated in Valencia that amateurs simply cannot produce the quality his style demands, and that holds true for this amateur. Canova starts with Elite athletes and aims to make them world class. It would be better to follow a plan made specifically for the type of athlete you are.\nWhat will I do next? In June 2020 I returned to Bobby Holcombe of Knoxville Endurance to get training more suited to my changing goals.
