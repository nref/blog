            <p>In the alum chat for <a href="https://www.mirdin.com">Mirdin</a>, someone posted the following question, &quot;Would it be better to start teaching beginners functional or imperative programming first?&quot;</p>
<p>Pretending for a second that FP and IP are the only choices (they're <a href="https://info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf">not</a>), an answer depends on where your beginner comes from.</p>
<p>A meta-pedagogical (teaching about teaching) answer acknowledges that learning starts in a place the learner feels <a href="https://argumatronic.com/posts/2018-09-02-effective-metaphor.html">grounded</a> and connects them from there to new knowledge. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing">subitizing </a> is an innate ability. A developmentally normal child can instantly know how many objects are presented, for values up to about 5.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
  <img src="../img/5_die.png"/>
  <p style="font-style: italic">Image: A die with 5 dots</p>
</div>
<p>From there, you can teach a 5-year-old arithemetic, for example to add, by having them subitize groups of objects alongside numerals and the math symbol <code>+</code>. This connects their innate notion of quantity to the abstract notion of numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a>, a masterpiece in teaching programming, falls heavily on the FP side, though they didn't have that vocabulary at the time. Watch Sussman absolutely rip apart side effects in <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/resources/5a-assignment-state-and-side-effects/">lecture 5A</a>. But not everybody &quot;gets&quot; this approach easily. Even Hal acknowledges in this <a href="https://corecursive.com/039-hal-abelson-sicp/">Corecursive interview</a> that the FP approach didn't work for everyone: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the very beginning days, we would teach a sort of short courses for MIT faculty and some of the electrical engineers would just get stuck. &quot;You haven‚Äôt showed us how the transistors work&quot;. ...People think different ways. Some people have to be grounded on where they‚Äôre comfortable and for some people, well, it really is transistors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrast that to somebody who knows what a function is, in the math sense. The machinery of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistor</a>, of gates, sources, drains, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic">TTL</a> will be an irritating detail, like multiplying matrices by hand.</p>
<p>So in the dichotomy between introducing FP and IP first, the answer might depend on where the learning is coming from. I personally learned IP and OOP first, because that's what teaching resources were available to me. I was first exposed to FP in college in the form of Scheme. It was disorienting. I couldn't count all the parentheses, let alone grok tail recursion. I wish it could have been presented to me grounded in terms of what I was already comfortable with, for example high school algebra.</p>
<p>I say, introduce multiple programming paradigms early on, and ground it in what the learner knows. A fundamental programming skill is to think at <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">multiple levels of abstraction</a>. The Haskell programmer needs to be aware that even monads at some point are just bits in a memory hierarchy, just as it's important for an assembly programmer to know that while register allocation is critical to performance, registers are not really what the program is about.</p>
<p>To close, let's ground this discussion in something we all know. To design a cathedral, the architect needs to know what bricks will be used. To build a cathedral, the bricklayer needs to envision the noble end to which each brick is set down.</p>
