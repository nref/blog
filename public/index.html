        <div class="post-content">
            <p>In the alum chat for <a href="https://www.mirdin.com">Mirdin</a>, someone posted the following question, &quot;Would it be better to start teaching beginners functional or imperative programming first?&quot;</p>
<p>Pretending for a second that FP and IP are the only choices (they're <a href="https://info.ucl.ac.be/~pvr/VanRoyChapter.pdf">not</a>), an answer depends on where your beginner comes from.</p>
<p>A meta-pedagogical (teaching about teaching) answer acknowledges that learning starts in a place the learner feels <a href="https://argumatronic.com/posts/2018-09-02-effective-metaphor.html">grounded</a> and connects them from there to new knowledge. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing">subitizing </a> is an innate ability. A developmentally normal child can instantly know how many objects are presented, for values up to about 5.</p>
<div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
  <img src="../img/5_die.png"/>
  <p style="font-style: italic">Image: A die with 5 dots</p>
</div>
<p>From there, you can teach a 5-year-old arithemetic, for example to add, by having them subitize groups of objects alongside numerals and the math symbol <code>+</code>. This connects their innate notion of quantity to the abstract notion of numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://web.mit.edu/6.001/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a>, a masterpiece in teaching programming, falls heavily on the FP side, though they didn't have that vocabulary at the time. Watch Sussman absolutely rip apart side effects in <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/resources/5a-assignment-state-and-side-effects/">lecture 5A</a>. But not everybody &quot;gets&quot; this approach easily. Even Hal acknowledges in this <a href="https://corecursive.com/039-hal-abelson-sicp/">Corecursive interview</a> that the FP approach didn't work for everyone: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the very beginning days, we would teach a sort of short courses for MIT faculty and some of the electrical engineers would just get stuck. &quot;You havenâ€™t showed us how the transistors work&quot;. ...People think different ways. Some people have to be grounded on where theyâ€™re comfortable and for some people, well, it really is transistors. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Contrast that to somebody who knows what a function is, in the math sense. The machinery of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor">transistor</a>, of gates, sources, drains, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor%E2%80%93transistor_logic">TTL</a> will be an irritating detail, like multiplying matrices by hand.</p>
<p>So in the dichotomy between introducing FP and IP first, the answer might depend on where the learning is coming from. I personally learned IP and OOP first, because that's what teaching resources were available to me. I was first exposed to FP in college in the form of Scheme. It was disorienting. I couldn't count all the parentheses, let alone grok tail recursion. I wish it could have been presented to me grounded in terms of what I was already comfortable with, for example high school algebra.</p>
<p>I say, introduce multiple programming paradigms early on, and ground it in what the learner knows. A fundamental programming skill is to think at <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">multiple levels of abstraction</a>. The Haskell programmer needs to be aware that even monads at some point are just bits in a memory hierarchy, just as it's important for an assembly programmer to know that while register allocation is critical to performance, registers are not really what the program is about.</p>
<p>To close, let's ground this discussion in something we all know. To design a cathedral, the architect needs to know what bricks will be used. To build a cathedral, the bricklayer needs to envision the noble end to which each brick is set down.</p>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>I'm always in search of good metaphors for software design. Good or not, here's one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Design is a Mold for Code</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In manufacturing, a mold is a hollow shape that fills with fluid material which expands into the space and sets to form a casting. </p>
<div style="text-align: center; width: 60%; margin: 0 auto;">
  <img src="../img/dall-e-muffin-pan.png"/>
  <p style="font-style: italic">Image: A useful mold. Generated by Dall-E</p>
</div>
<p>Like in manufacturing, code fills the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_space">negative space</a> of a software design. Over time, code sets and becomes harder to change.</p>
<p>Imagine two engineering teams who independently &quot;fill&quot; (implement) a design, and the design is the set of standards for a web browser. The two implementations are Chrome and Firefox. The two browsers have independent codebases<sup>[<a href="https://www.slater.dev/a-design-is-a-mold-for-code/#notes">1</a>]</sup> which take vastly different shapes, but as far as web standards are concerned, the two are equal. You could switch from Chrome to Firefox (which I <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/12/chrome-users-beware-manifest-v3-deceitful-and-threatening">recommend</a>) and still browse compliant web pages with no discernible change. </p>
<p>Programmers who also like math sometimes call two pieces of code which can be swapped <a href="https://blog.ploeh.dk/2018/01/08/software-design-isomorphisms/">isomorphic</a> with respect to the spec.</p>
<p>It's important not to reverse the causality: a design causes the work product, not the converse. A mold causes a casting, and a software design causes code. Nevertheless, to some extent, one can go in reverse, i.e. reconstruct a mold from a casting or infer a design from code. </p>
<p>The reconstructed mold might lose some fidelity, like sharp edges or precise dimensions, but it's far worse for code. Looking at code without supplemental information, a new dev can only infer a dim, vague notion of its design. She might even sense the mind(s) behind the design. However, it would be costly if even possible to losslessly reconstruct the design, i.e. to such a fidelity that it could be the basis for an isomorphic implementation.</p>
<p>In pseudocode:</p>
<pre style="background-color:#1e1e1e;color:#dcdcdc;"><code><span>[Test]
</span><span>fn Reverse_ProducesIsomorphicDesign()
</span><span>    let design1 : ...
</span><span>    let code1 = implement(design1)
</span><span>    let design2 = reverse(code1)
</span><span>    let code2 = implement(design2)
</span><span>    assert(isomorphic(code1, code2)) // Fails
</span></code></pre>
<p>Above: The roundtrip from a design to code back to design is lossy.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this:</p>
<ul>
<li>A codebase maybe too large to fit into a dev's head. The codebases for Chrome and Firefox are huge. Like the limited context window of ChatGPT, a human has limited working memory and forgets. Though with time and repetition, knowledge transitions to long-term memory.</li>
<li>It's hard to infer high-level concepts from low-level details. For example, decompiling assembly back to C.</li>
<li>Design and code have a many-to-many relationship.
<ul>
<li>There can be many implementations that satisfy a design.</li>
<li>There can be many designs that result in the same code.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a problem for software that outlives its creator(s). The software will languish unless knowledge is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_memory">retained</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">replicated</a>.</p>
<p>There are some things developers can do to keep their software alive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write down the design. Use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming">natural language</a></li>
<li>Make the <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2018/01/the-design-of-software-is-thing-apart.html">design apparent in the code</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="https://www.pathsensitive.com/2022/03/abstraction-not-what-you-think-it-is.html">precise abstractions</a></li>
<li>Use <a href="https://argumatronic.com/posts/2018-09-02-effective-metaphor.html">effective</a> <a href="https://gist.github.com/onlurking/fc5c81d18cfce9ff81bc968a7f342fb1#tacit-knowledge-and-documentation">metaphors</a></li>
<li>Make the code <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/code-that-fits/9780137464302/">fit in your head</a></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>
<ol>
<li>Firefox and Chrome are not truly independent by this definition. Plenty of people who have worked on one browser have also worked on the other. Moreover, as open source projects, both teams can see the other's code. <a href="https://source.chromium.org/chromium/chromium/src/+/main:">Chromium source</a> and <a href="https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source">Firefox source</a> </li>
