  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>In April, I built a new PC out of these parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Threadripper 3970x</li>
<li>MSI TRX40 PRO</li>
<li>G.SKILL Trident Z Neo Series 64GB (2 x 32GB)</li>
<li>EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB GDDR5X</li>
<li>Samsung 970 EVO</li>
<li>EVGA 1000 GQ</li>
<li>Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3</li>
<li>Fractal Design Meshify C</li>
</ul>
<p>Total cost: <strong>$3863.98</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why did I build it?</strong> Iâ€™m a software developer, and I spend all day in Visual Studio. I had just gotten hired at a new employer, and I expected to be doing a fair amount of C++ compilation. For the rest of my development tasks, I wanted to be comfortably over-provisioned.</p>
<p><strong>Do I like it?</strong> Emphatically yes. Developing on it is a dream. I am spoiled to work on any other machine. It is fun to watch all 64 logical processors max out in Task Manager during compilation. I love spinning up a virtual machine and whimsically assigning 16 cores and as many gigabytes of RAM. I feel like a teenager with a 500hp engine under his foot.</p>

<em>Image: All cores maxed out compiling <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259903810_The_open-radART_ion_ORAion_Software_Suite">open-radART</a>. Vroom!</em></p>
<p><strong>It is worth it?</strong> I find the performance-per-dollar to be very high. I was pleased to see that Linus Torvalds himself <a href="http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2005.3/00406.html">praised his 3970x</a>. I find performance to be a good balance between the cheaper 3960x and the pricey 3990x. I literally could not find any prebuilt machines of this caliber, but if I could have, they would have easily cost over $6000.</p>
