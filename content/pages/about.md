Hi! I'm Doug. I am a software dev, athlete, husband, and Christian. 

## Software

I design software for a living.

The tools I use professionally include C#, Python, C, C++, XAML, and SQL.

On the side, I'm learning Rust, Go, and Typescript.

I do desktop and mobile frontend work with WPF, Avalonia, Xamarin.Forms, MAUI, and Uno. I eat MVVM for breakfast.

I do backend web services in ASP.NET Core.

I love to migrate code off .NET Framework.

I like math and algorithms. I always have a can of Linear Algebra in my backpack.

I'm big on software design. I manage complexity, create precise abstractions, and draw correct boundaries.

I run a boostrapped company called [EnduraByte](https://www.endurabyte.com) where I create [FitEdit](https://www.fitedit.io).

Ping me if you want to hire me.

## Athlete

I run and swim competitively. Find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16771342) or [Athlinks](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/267108569).

## Husband

Abby is the best wife ever.

## Christian

Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. I go to [Immanuel Church](https://www.iknox.org).
