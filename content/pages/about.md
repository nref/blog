Hi! I'm Doug. I am a software dev, athlete, husband, and Christian. 

## Software

I design software for a living. Message me if you'd like to work with me.

The tools I use professionally include C#, Python, C, C++, XAML, and SQL. Haskell, Rust, and anything that usurps JavaScript (examples: WASM, PureScript, TypeScript, Fable) are also interesting. 

Skills that transcend specific tech keywords are especially exciting:

- **Functional programming**. Based in math and a history going back to the 1930s, FP is the [end-game](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2014/03/10/solid-the-next-step-is-functional/) of SOLID principles. It lets us keep programs testable and easy to understand by maximizing composability, minimizing mutability, and pushing state to program boundaries.  
- **Math**. Math lends rigor and stability to the otherwise young and shifting field of software.
  - [Category](https://blog.ploeh.dk/2017/10/04/from-design-patterns-to-category-theory/) [theory](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/) helps one understand how the algebra you learned in high school is just like code.
  - I always have a can of Linear Algebra nearby. 
- **Static typing**. Let your compiler be your tester.
- **Software design**. Good design wrangles complexity, defines precise abstractions, draws correct boundaries, and endures. I'm a fan of [DDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design) and [hexagonal architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexagonal_architecture_(software)).

Some of my projects:

- [RayCommand](https://www.raysearchlabs.com/raycommand/). Beautiful WPF frontend, 3D graphics, and C# services supporting the needs of radiation therapy clinics
- [FitEdit](https://www.fitedit.io). An Avalonia MVVM frontend and ASP.NET Core backend built on Supabase. Integrates with Garmin and Strava. A SaaS offering for athletes and fitness enthustiasts
- [Treadmill](https://github.com/nref/treadmill). A circuit board designed in KiCad and Xamarin/MAUI Android app for controlling a treadmill
- [Irrlicht.Net](https://github.com/nref/Irrlicht.Net), [Ompl.Net](https://github.com/nref/Ompl.NetStandard), [Kdl.Net](https://github.com/nref/Kdl.NetStandard). C# wrappers for popular C++ libraries
- [BrowserRouter](https://github.com/nref/BrowseRouter). Launches a different URL depending on the URL
- ...and more on [GitHub](https://github.com/nref/)

## Athlete

I run and swim competitively. Find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/16771342) or [Athlinks](https://www.athlinks.com/athletes/267108569).

## Husband

Abby is the best wife ever.

## Christian

Jesus is the way, the truth, and the life. I go to [Immanuel Church](https://www.iknox.org).
