Programming computers is hard because, as [Hal put it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-J_xL4IGhJA), it isn't about programming, and it isn't about computers.

Even the most mundane of programming issues are rooted in profound questions:

- "Why are my dependencies broken?" => "What is causality?" <sup>\[[1](#References)\]</sup>
- "Should I check for null?" => "When can we know a program is correct? Design time compile time, or run time?"  <sup>\[[2,3](#References)\]</sup>
- "Why don't I understand this code?" => "What is memory, cognition, and language?" <sup>\[[4](#References)\]</sup>
- "Why is this program buggy?" => "What is a proof?" <sup>\[[5,6](#References)\]</sup>

While you'll overhear the questions on the left rising from the desks of developers on a Tuesday afternoon, their answers are surprisingly elusive and timeless.
