### Christian Pull Requests

I'm a software developer, so the terms [pull request](https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/380) and [code review](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review) are part of my daily vernacular.

I'm also a Christian and go to a weekly Bible study.

At Bible study,  after the lesson, and sometimes before, the group shares "prayer requests". This is a chance for participants to pray for each other and for people outside the group.

Unless requested not to, we record these prayer requests in a group messaging app. It can be hard to take down requests on a smartphone, so I often bring my laptop to keep up.

At the end of Bible study one recent Sunday night, I pulled out my laptop and announced, "Ok, I am taking pull requests!"

Not knowing what I had just said, I looked around and saw blank eyes looking back.

"Guys, I mean _prayer_ requests!"

Having my laptop open may have triggered something code-related in my brain.
