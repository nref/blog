In April, I built a new PC out of these parts:

- Threadripper 3970x
- MSI TRX40 PRO
- G.SKILL Trident Z Neo Series 64GB (2 x 32GB)
- EVGA GeForce GTX 1080 8GB GDDR5X
- Samsung 970 EVO
- EVGA 1000 GQ
- Noctua NH-U14S TR4-SP3
- Fractal Design Meshify C

Total cost: **$3863.98**

**Why did I build it?** I'm a software developer, and I spend all day in Visual Studio. I had just gotten hired at a new employer, and I expected to be doing a fair amount of C++ compilation. For the rest of my development tasks, I wanted to be comfortably over-provisioned. 

**Do I like it?** Emphatically yes. Developing on it is a dream. I am spoiled to work on any other machine. It is fun to watch all 64 logical processors max out in Task Manager during compilation. I love spinning up a virtual machine and whimsically assigning 16 cores and as many gigabytes of RAM. I feel like a teenager with a 500hp engine under his foot.

**It is worth it?** I find the performance-per-dollar to be very high. I was pleased to see that Linus Torvalds himself [praised his 3970x](http://lkml.iu.edu/hypermail/linux/kernel/2005.3/00406.html). I find performance to be a good balance between the cheaper 3960x and the pricey 3990x. I literally could not find any prebuilt machines of this caliber, but if I could have, they would have easily cost over $6000.
