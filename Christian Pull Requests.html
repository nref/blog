  <div class="stackedit__html"><p>I’m a software developer, so the terms <a href="https://opensource.stackexchange.com/a/380">pull request</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">code review</a> are part of my daily vernacular.</p>
<p>I’m also a Christian and go to a weekly Bible study.</p>
<p>At Bible study,  after the lesson, and sometimes before, the group shares “prayer requests”. This is a chance for participants to pray for each other and for people outside the group.</p>
<p>Unless requested not to, we record these prayer requests in a group messaging app. It can be hard to take down requests on a smartphone, so I often bring my laptop to keep up.</p>
<p>At the end of Bible study one recent Sunday night, I pulled out my laptop and announced, “Ok, I am taking pull requests!”</p>
<p>Not knowing what I had just said, I looked around and saw blank eyes looking back.</p>
<p>“Guys, I mean <em>prayer</em> requests!”</p>
<p>Having my laptop open may have triggered something code-related in my brain.</p>
